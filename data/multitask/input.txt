[CODE]
Q: What are closures in JavaScript?
A: Closures are functions that retain access to their lexical scope, even when executed outside that scope.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between let, const, and var?
A: var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped. const cannot be reassigned.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between null and undefined?

[CODE]
Q: What is this in JavaScript?
A: this refers to the object from which the function was called, depending on the context.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?
A: Shallow copy copies object references; deep copy copies all nested values recursively.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between == and ===?
A: == performs type coercion before comparison; === compares both value and type.

[CODE]
Q: What is NaN?
A: NaN stands for "Not-a-Number". It's returned when a math operation fails or yields a non-numeric result.

[CODE]
Q: How do you check if a value is NaN?
A: Use Number.isNaN(value) or isNaN(value) with caution due to type coercion.

[CODE]
Q: What is a pure function?
A: A pure function always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.

[CODE]
Q: What is memoization?
A: Memoization is an optimization that caches the results of expensive function calls.

[CODE]
Q: What are higher-order functions?
A: Higher-order functions take other functions as arguments or return functions.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between map(), filter(), and reduce()?
A: map() transforms elements, filter() removes elements based on a condition, and reduce() accumulates values into a single result.

[CODE]
Q: What is destructuring?
A: Destructuring is a syntax for extracting values from arrays or objects into variables.

[CODE]
Q: What is the spread operator?
A: The spread operator (...) expands an array or object into individual elements.

[CODE]
Q: What is the rest operator?
A: The rest operator (...) collects all remaining elements into an array or object.

[CODE]
Q: What are template literals?
A: Template literals are strings using backticks (`) that allow interpolation with ${} syntax.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between call(), apply(), and bind()?
A: call() and apply() invoke functions immediately with different argument formats; bind() returns a new bound function.

[CODE]
Q: What is the prototype chain?
A: It's the chain of an object's prototype through which inheritance is established.

[CODE]
Q: What are falsy values in JavaScript?
A: Falsy values are false, 0, '', null, undefined, and NaN.

[CODE]
Q: What is event bubbling?
A: Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event starts from the deepest element and bubbles up to its ancestors.

[CODE]
Q: What is event delegation?
A: Event delegation is attaching an event listener to a parent element instead of each child for performance and dynamic handling.

[CODE]
Q: What is the DOM?
A: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree structure representing the HTML elements of a webpage.

[CODE]
Q: What is localStorage?
A: localStorage is a Web Storage API that stores key-value pairs with no expiration date.

[CODE]
Q: What is a callback function?
A: A callback function is passed into another function to be executed later.

[CODE]
Q: What is async/await?
A: async/await is syntactic sugar for handling promises in a cleaner, more readable way.

[CODE]
Q: What is a generator function?
A: A generator function returns an iterator and uses the yield keyword to pause execution.

[CODE]
Q: What are modules in JavaScript?
A: Modules allow you to split code into reusable pieces using import and export.

[CODE]
Q: What is a symbol in JavaScript?
A: Symbol is a primitive type for creating unique identifiers.

[CODE]
Q: What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?
A: The TDZ is the period between entering scope and the point where a‚ÄØlet‚ÄØor‚ÄØconst‚ÄØvariable is declared. Accessing the variable inside this window throws a‚ÄØReferenceError‚ÄØinstead of returning‚ÄØundefined.

[CODE]
Q: What does the new operator do in JavaScript?
A: It creates a new empty object, sets the function‚Äôs prototype as the new object's prototype, binds‚ÄØthis‚ÄØinside the constructor to that object, and implicitly returns the object unless the constructor returns another non‚Äëprimitive.

[CODE]
Q: What is lexical scope?
A: Lexical scope means that a variable‚Äôs scope is determined by its physical location in source code; inner functions have access to variables defined in their outer (lexically enclosing) scopes.

[CODE]
Q: How does prototypal inheritance differ from classical inheritance?
A: In prototypal inheritance, objects inherit directly from other objects via a prototype chain; there are no classes‚Äîbehaviour is shared by delegation at runtime. Classical inheritance relies on class hierarchies copied at instantiation.

[CODE]
Q: What is event capturing?
A: Event capturing (trickling) is the first phase of the DOM event flow in which the event travels from the window down to the target element before bubbling back up.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between for...in and for...of loops?
A: for...in iterates over enumerable property keys (including inherited ones) of an object, while for...of iterates over the values produced by an iterable‚Äôs‚ÄØSymbol.iterator, such as array elements.

[CODE]
Q: What does the super keyword do in ES6 classes?
A: Inside a subclass,‚ÄØsuper‚ÄØlets you call the parent class‚Äôs constructor (super(args)) or access methods and getters/setters on the parent prototype.

[CODE]
Q: What is tail call optimization (TCO)?
A: TCO is a JavaScript‚Äëengine optimization that reuses the current stack frame for a function‚Äôs final (tail) call, preventing additional stack growth and enabling efficient recursion.

[CODE]
Q: How can you create private fields in an ES2022 class?
A: Prefix a field name with #, e.g., class C { #count = 0; inc(){ this.#count++; } }; the field is truly private and cannot be accessed outside the class body.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between the microtask queue and the macrotask queue?
A: Microtasks (e.g., resolved promises, MutationObserver callbacks) run right after the current call stack empties and before the browser repaints; macrotasks (e.g.,‚ÄØsetTimeout, I/O) are scheduled for the next event‚Äëloop turn.

[CODE]
Q: What is a Service Worker?
A: A Service Worker is a background script that sits between the web page and network, enabling features like offline caching, push notifications, and network interception via the Fetch API.

[CODE]
Q: What is the Fetch API?
A: The Fetch API is a modern promise‚Äëbased interface (fetch(url, options)) for making network requests that replaces‚ÄØXMLHttpRequest‚ÄØwith a cleaner, more powerful API.

[CODE]
Q: What is Cross‚ÄëOrigin Resource Sharing (CORS)?
A: CORS is a browser security mechanism that allows servers to indicate which origins are permitted to access resources via special HTTP headers like‚ÄØAccess‚ÄëControl‚ÄëAllow‚ÄëOrigin.

[CODE]
Q: What is the same‚Äëorigin policy?
A: Browsers restrict scripts to interact only with resources from the same origin (protocol, host, port) to prevent malicious cross‚Äësite interactions; CORS provides controlled relaxation.

[CODE]
Q: Compare HTTP cookies with localStorage and sessionStorage.
A: Cookies are key‚Äëvalue pairs sent with every HTTP request and can have custom lifetimes.‚ÄØlocalStorage‚ÄØpersists data indefinitely in the browser and is not sent automatically.‚ÄØsessionStorage‚ÄØlasts per‚Äëtab until the tab is closed.

[CODE]
Q: What is the purpose of the async attribute on a <script> tag?
A: async downloads the script in parallel and executes it as soon as it finishes, without blocking HTML parsing; execution order is unpredictable relative to other async scripts.

[CODE]
Q: What does the defer attribute do on a <script> tag?
A: defer downloads the script in parallel but delays execution until after HTML parsing is complete, preserving script order and not blocking rendering.

[CODE]
Q: How does Object.create(null) differ from {}?
A: Object.create(null) produces an object with no prototype, meaning it lacks inherited properties like‚ÄØtoString; {}‚ÄØinherits from‚ÄØObject.prototype.

[CODE]
Q: What is the purpose of the constructor property on a prototype?
A: It points back to the function that created the instance, allowing identification of the constructor and enabling patterns like re‚Äëinstantiation.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between mutable and immutable objects in JavaScript?
A: Mutable objects can have their state changed after creation (e.g., plain objects, arrays). Immutable objects cannot be changed once created (e.g., String, Number, frozen objects).

[CODE]
Q: What is JSON and what are its common operations in JS?
A: JSON is a text format for structured data. Common operations are‚ÄØJSON.stringify(object)‚ÄØto serialize and‚ÄØJSON.parse(string)‚ÄØto deserialize.

[CODE]
Q: What does Promise.all do?
A: It returns a promise that fulfills with an array of results when all input promises fulfill, or rejects as soon as one promise rejects.

[CODE]
Q: Explain Promise.race.
A: Promise.race returns a promise that settles (fulfills or rejects) as soon as the first input promise settles, adopting that promise‚Äôs result or reason.

[CODE]
Q: What is Promise.any?
A: Promise.any fulfills as soon as one of the input promises fulfills, ignoring rejected ones; it rejects only if all promises reject (AggregateError).

[CODE]
Q: What is Promise.allSettled?
A: It returns a promise that fulfills after all input promises settle, providing an array of objects describing each promise‚Äôs status and value/reason.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between splice() and slice()?
A: splice() mutates an array, removing/replacing/adding elements and returns removed items;‚ÄØslice() returns a new array containing a shallow copy of selected elements without mutating.

[CODE]
Q: What does Array.from() do?
A: Array.from() creates a new array from an array‚Äëlike or iterable object and can take a mapping function as a second argument.

[CODE]
Q: Explain Array.prototype.flat() and flatMap().
A: flat(depth) returns a new array with nested arrays flattened up to the given depth; flatMap() maps each element then flattens one level, combining map and flat.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries()?
A: keys returns an array of own enumerable property names, values returns the corresponding values, and entries returns [key, value] pairs.

[CODE]
Q: What is Symbol.iterator used for?
A: It defines the default iteration behavior of an object so it can be used in for...of, spread syntax, or other iterable‚Äëconsuming constructs.

[CODE]
Q: How do you make an object iterable?
A: Implement a method keyed by Symbol.iterator that returns an iterator object with a next() method yielding {value, done} pairs.

[CODE]
Q: Compare currying and partial application.
A: Currying transforms a function of‚ÄØN‚ÄØarguments into‚ÄØN‚ÄØunary functions; partial application fixes some arguments of a function, returning a new function expecting the rest.

[CODE]
Q: What is Object.defineProperty() used for?
A: It defines or updates a property with precise control over descriptors like‚ÄØvalue,‚ÄØwritable,‚ÄØconfigurable,‚ÄØenumerable,‚ÄØget, and‚ÄØset.

[CODE]
Q: What is a Proxy in JavaScript?
A: A Proxy wraps a target object and intercepts fundamental operations (get, set, has, etc.) via handler traps, enabling custom behavior like validation or virtual properties.

[CODE]
Q: What is the Reflect API?
A: Reflect is a built‚Äëin object that provides methods corresponding to many object‚Äëinternal operations (e.g., Reflect.get, Reflect.set) making meta‚Äëprogramming more intuitive and used by Proxy handlers.

[CODE]
Q: What is the Intl (Internationalization) API used for?
A: Intl provides language‚Äësensitive functionality such as number, date, and currency formatting (Intl.NumberFormat, Intl.DateTimeFormat) and string collation.

[CODE]
Q: When would you use encodeURI vs encodeURIComponent?
A: encodeURI encodes a complete URI but leaves reserved characters (: / ? #) intact; encodeURIComponent encodes URI components, escaping almost all non‚Äëalphanumeric characters.

[CODE]
Q: What are btoa() and atob() functions?
A: btoa encodes a binary string to Base64; atob decodes Base64 back to a binary string (both operate on Latin‚Äë1 byte sequences).

[CODE]
Q: Compare using requestAnimationFrame to throttling scroll events.
A: requestAnimationFrame schedules a callback right before the next repaint, producing smooth animations; throttling limits event handler frequency to a fixed interval, which may not sync with the browser‚Äôs refresh rate.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between the load and DOMContentLoaded events?
A: DOMContentLoaded fires when the initial HTML is parsed and the DOM is ready, while load fires later when all resources‚Äîincluding images, styles, and subframes‚Äîhave finished loading.

[CODE]
Q: What is the Shadow DOM?
A: The Shadow DOM is a web‚Äëcomponent specification that lets you create encapsulated DOM trees with scoped CSS, preventing style leakage and collisions.

[CODE]
Q: What are Web Components?
A: They are a suite of standards (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML templates) enabling reusable, encapsulated UI widgets natively in the browser.

[CODE]
Q: How would you detect a memory leak in JavaScript?
A: Use browser dev tools‚Äô performance/memory profiling to record heap snapshots over time and look for uncollected retained objects, detached DOM nodes, or increasing allocation sizes.

[CODE]
Q: Why should you always provide the radix to parseInt?
A: Without a radix, parseInt may interpret strings with a leading‚ÄØ0‚ÄØas octal in non‚Äëstrict mode; specifying radix (10) ensures consistent base‚Äë10 parsing.

[CODE]
Q: What is the purpose of Object.prototype.toString.call(value)?
A: It returns a string like [object Type] that reveals the internal [[Class]], useful for detecting built‚Äëin types such as Array or Date.

[CODE]
Q: How do you check if an object has its own property?
A: Use Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key) or Reflect.has(obj, key) and ensure the property is not inherited from the prototype chain.

[CODE]
Q: Explain the default behavior of Array.prototype.sort() and stable sort.
A: Without a comparator, sort() converts elements to strings and orders them lexicographically; since ES2019 the algorithm must be stable, preserving the relative order of equal elements.

[CODE]
Q: What is optional chaining (?.)?
A: Optional chaining lets you safely access nested properties or call functions that might be null or undefined, returning undefined instead of throwing an error.

[CODE]
Q: What is the nullish coalescing operator (??)?
A: ?? returns the right‚Äëhand operand only when the left‚Äëhand operand is null or undefined, unlike || which treats all falsy values as triggers.

[CODE]
Q: What is BigInt and when would you use it?
A: BigInt is a primitive type for representing whole numbers larger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER; you create one with the n suffix (e.g., 9007199254740993n).

[CODE]
Q: What are WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry?
A: WeakRef holds a weak reference to an object without preventing its garbage collection; FinalizationRegistry allows you to register a cleanup callback that runs after the object is collected.

[CODE]
Q: What does structuredClone() do?
A: It performs a deep, structured copy of most built‚Äëin types, supports circular references, and preserves object types‚Äîunlike JSON.stringify/parse.

[CODE]
Q: What is AbortController used for?
A: AbortController provides a signal object that can abort fetch requests, streams, or any API accepting an AbortSignal, enabling cancellation of asynchronous operations.

[CODE]
Q: What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?
A: EventEmitter is a core Node.js class that facilitates the pub/sub pattern; you can emit named events and register listeners with‚ÄØon,‚ÄØonce, or‚ÄØremoveListener.

[CODE]
Q: What is the difference between module.exports and exports in Node.js?
A: exports is a shorthand that initially references module.exports; assigning a new object to exports breaks the link, so prefer modifying module.exports directly.

[CODE]
Q: What is a Buffer in Node.js?
A: Buffer is a global class for dealing with binary data‚Äîraw memory allocations used in networking, file I/O, or crypto operations.

[CODE]
Q: What is the purpose of the cluster module in Node.js?
A: cluster allows a Node.js process to fork multiple worker processes that share the same server port, enabling horizontal scaling across CPU cores.

[CODE]
Q: How does the V8 engine compile JavaScript?
A: V8 parses source code into an AST, produces bytecode interpreted by Ignition, and uses TurboFan JIT to optimize hot paths into machine code, performing inline caches and speculative optimizations.

[CODE]
Q: What is dynamic import (import())?
A: import(path) is an asynchronous function‚Äëlike form that loads ES modules on demand, returning a promise that resolves to the module namespace object.

[CODE]
Q: What is optional catch binding?
A: Since ES2019, you can omit the error parameter in a catch clause (catch { ‚Ä¶ }) when you don't need to reference the thrown error.
