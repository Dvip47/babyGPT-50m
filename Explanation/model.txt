Step-by-step Explanation of model.py
üîπ Imports

import math, torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
math: Normal math operations, like square root.

torch: Main PyTorch library.

torch.nn: Tools for building neural networks.

torch.nn.functional: For functions like loss calculations (e.g., cross_entropy).

üß© SelfAttention class

class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
This class builds one multi-head self-attention layer ‚Äî the heart of the transformer.

Key components:

self.n_head = n_head
self.key = nn.Linear(n_embd, n_embd)
self.query = nn.Linear(n_embd, n_embd)
self.value = nn.Linear(n_embd, n_embd)
We split the input into Key, Query, Value using linear layers.

These are mathematical representations used in attention to calculate which words are important.

Causal Mask

mask = torch.tril(torch.ones(block_size, block_size)).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)
self.register_buffer("mask", mask)
This is a triangular mask to ensure the model can't "cheat" and look at future tokens.

It forces the model to look only at past and current tokens ‚Äî essential for generating text one step at a time.

üîÅ Forward pass for Attention

def forward(self, x):
    ...
Converts x into keys, queries, and values for each head.

Applies attention formula: Attention = softmax(Q * K^T / sqrt(dk)) * V

Applies the mask so it doesn‚Äôt look ahead.

Then combines the heads and projects it back to original shape.

üî∑ Block class (Transformer Block)

class Block(nn.Module):
Each Block = Self Attention + Feedforward Neural Net + LayerNorm


self.sa = SelfAttention(...)
self.ln1 = nn.LayerNorm(...)
self.ff = nn.Sequential(...)
self.ln2 = nn.LayerNorm(...)
It applies:

Attention ‚Üí Add to input

Feedforward ‚Üí Add to previous result

This "residual connection" helps in stable deep learning.

‚öôÔ∏è GPTConfig

class GPTConfig:
Just a simple config holder ‚Äî stores number of layers, heads, vocab size, etc., and is passed to GPT.

üß† GPT Main Model

class GPT(nn.Module):
Now this is the actual GPT model. Think of this as the big brain made of many small blocks.

Key components:

self.tok_emb = nn.Embedding(cfg.vocab_size, cfg.n_embd)
Converts token IDs to vector embeddings (a.k.a meaning vectors).


self.pos_emb = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, cfg.block_size, cfg.n_embd))
Adds position info ‚Äî like word #1, #2 etc. (because transformer doesn‚Äôt know order by default)


self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([...])
Builds N blocks (like N layers deep).


self.head = nn.Linear(cfg.n_embd, cfg.vocab_size)
Converts model output back to vocabulary size so it can predict the next token.

üîÅ forward()

def forward(self, idx, targets=None):
Takes input tokens (idx)

Embeds them + adds position info

Passes through transformer blocks

Applies layer norm + final head

If targets provided (in training), also calculates loss using cross_entropy


return logits, loss
‚úÖ Summary in Human Words:
Concept	Explanation
SelfAttention	Learns how much to "pay attention" to previous words
Block	Combination of attention and feedforward layers
GPTConfig	Holds configuration like layer count, vocab size etc.
GPT	The final full model that processes tokens and generates output
