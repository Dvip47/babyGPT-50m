Tokenizer Line-by-line walkthrough (teacher mode)

import os
import tiktoken
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm
🧑‍🏫 We’re importing the tools we need.

os: to create folders and handle file paths.

tiktoken: the GPT-style tokenizer.

numpy: for fast handling of large arrays.

tqdm: for progress bars (not used yet, but often useful).

def prepare_tokenizer_and_bins(...):
🧑‍🏫 We define a function that takes a text file, converts it into token IDs, splits it, and saves it.


enc = tiktoken.get_encoding(vocab_model)
🧑‍🏫 Here, we load the GPT-2 tokenizer.
This gives us a tool to convert text into numbers (token IDs). Each token is a piece of a word.


with open(input_path, 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
🧑‍🏫 We open and read the full text file into memory as one big string.
Imagine reading a whole novel and putting it in a variable.


tokens = enc.encode(data)
🧑‍🏫 This line converts that big string into a list of integers.
Each number represents a token — a piece of text. For example, "hello" might become [15496].


split_idx = int(len(tokens) * train_split)
train_ids = tokens[:split_idx]
val_ids = tokens[split_idx:]
🧑‍🏫 We divide the token list: 90% for training, 10% for validation.
Why? So the model learns on the training data and we test it on unseen validation data.


train_ids = np.array(train_ids, dtype=np.uint16)
val_ids = np.array(val_ids, dtype=np.uint16)
🧑‍🏫 We convert token lists into NumPy arrays (very fast and memory-efficient).
Using uint16 saves space. This is important if you’re training on millions of tokens.


os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
🧑‍🏫 Make sure the folder for saving data exists.
If it doesn’t, this line will create it.


train_ids.tofile(train_out)
val_ids.tofile(val_out)
🧑‍🏫 Save both arrays directly as .bin binary files.
Why binary? Because it's fast for training. The model can load data quickly.


meta = {
    'vocab_size': enc.n_vocab,
    'block_size': block_size,
    'tokenizer': vocab_model
}
🧑‍🏫 We store some important metadata:

vocab_size: how many unique tokens the tokenizer knows.

block_size: how many tokens the model looks at in one shot.

tokenizer: which tokenizer we used (so we can decode later).


with open(..., 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(meta, f)
🧑‍🏫 We save the metadata using pickle (a way to save Python dictionaries to disk).


print(...)  # print summary
🧑‍🏫 Finally, we print a summary: how many tokens went to training and validation, and confirm files were saved.

👨‍🏫 Summary
So, Vipin, this script bridges the gap between text and training.
Without this step, your GPT model has no idea how to read your data.

You can now use the .bin files and meta.pkl in your training script like a pro.
