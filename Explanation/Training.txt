#Imports (Bringing in all necessary tools)
import os
import pickle
os: For handling file paths and directories.

pickle: Used to load saved Python objects ‚Äî here, it loads your tokenizer's metadata (meta.pkl).

from config.config_50m import *
‚úÖ This brings in all the training and model settings you wrote in config/config_50m.py, like n_layer, block_size, learning_rate, etc.

from model import GPT, GPTConfig
This imports your GPT model class and its configuration.

GPTConfig: defines model architecture.

GPT: actually builds the model using that config.

from trainer import Trainer, TrainerConfig
These classes handle training logic.

TrainerConfig: defines how to train.

Trainer: manages the full training loop (forward, backward, evaluate, save model, etc.).

from dataset import get_batch
This function fetches a mini-batch of training or validation data.

Returns input tokens X and target tokens Y.

import torch
PyTorch is the deep learning engine powering it all.

üì¶ Load Metadata (vocab and block size)
print("üì¶ Loading metadata...")
with open(f'data/{dataset}/meta.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    meta = pickle.load(f)
Loads your saved tokenizer metadata (created during preprocessing).

meta.pkl includes:

vocab_size: how many tokens in your vocabulary.

block_size: how many tokens per sequence.

vocab_size = meta['vocab_size']
block_size = meta['block_size']
print(f"üìö Vocab size: {vocab_size}, block size: {block_size}")
Reads those two values from the loaded dictionary and prints them.

Even if they were None in your config file, they are now real values.

üß† Create Model Config
config = GPTConfig(
    vocab_size=vocab_size,
    block_size=block_size,
    n_layer=n_layer,
    n_head=n_head,
    n_embd=n_embd,
    dropout=dropout,
    bias=bias
)
This constructs a blueprint for your GPT model.

You pass in:

How deep (n_layer)

How wide (n_embd)

How many heads (n_head)

Whether to use bias

How big input should be (block_size)

How many tokens exist (vocab_size)

Whether to apply dropout

üß± Build the Model
model = GPT(config)
This builds the actual neural network using the above config.

print(f"üß† Model initialized with {sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()) / 1e6:.2f}M parameters")
This counts all trainable parameters in the model and prints size in millions.

A way to confirm you‚Äôre training a 50M model or whatever size you expect.

üñ•Ô∏è Choose Device
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
model.to(device)
Checks if you have a GPU (cuda). If not, use CPU.

Moves the model to that device so it can train there.

‚öôÔ∏è Training Configuration
tconf = TrainerConfig(
    max_iters=max_iters,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    block_size=block_size,
    learning_rate=learning_rate,
    lr_decay_iters=lr_decay_iters,
    warmup_iters=warmup_iters,
    min_lr=min_lr,
    device=device,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=gradient_accumulation_steps,
    out_dir=out_dir,
    eval_interval=eval_interval,
    eval_iters=eval_iters,
    log_interval=log_interval
)
This sets up everything the Trainer class needs to know:

How long to train (max_iters)

How fast to learn (learning_rate)

Where to save (out_dir)

How often to log and evaluate

How much to accumulate gradients before updating weights

Think of this like the training manual for your AI student.

üöÄ Start Training
trainer = Trainer(model, get_batch, tconf)
Initializes the trainer with:

The model

The data loader (get_batch)

All the training settings (tconf)

print("üöÄ Training begins...")
trainer.train()
Starts the actual training loop.

Under the hood:

Fetches data batches

Runs forward pass

Computes loss

Backpropagates gradients

Updates weights

Evaluates and saves best model

Logs everything

‚úÖ Summary
This file does 4 main things:

Loads tokenizer metadata.

Builds the GPT model.

Prepares training settings.

Starts the training loop.

This is your launch file.
Like pressing the green "Run" button in PyTorch land.
