#Config

out_dir = 'out/babygpt_50m'
👉 This is the folder where all the trained checkpoints, logs, and evaluation results will be saved.
Think of it like your model’s diary — it keeps track of its progress here.

🧪 eval_interval = 250
👉 Every 250 training steps, your model will pause and evaluate itself using the validation dataset.

It checks:

"Am I improving?"

"Is my validation loss going down?"

📝 log_interval = 50
👉 Every 50 steps, it prints out the training loss.
Useful for monitoring if the model is learning or going crazy.

🔁 eval_iters = 200
👉 During evaluation, the model won't just look at 1 example — it will take 200 mini-batches and calculate the average loss.

Why?

To get a stable and accurate measurement of its performance.

📊 wandb_log = False
👉 This turns Weights & Biases logging OFF.
Weights & Biases (wandb) is a tool for tracking training visually on a web dashboard.
You can set this to True later to monitor your training live on wandb.ai.

📁 wandb_project = 'babygpt-50m'
📛 wandb_run_name = 'ft-run'
These are just names:

Project: your folder on W&B

Run name: what this specific experiment is called.

You're not using wandb now, so these are just placeholders.

📚 dataset = 'multitask'
👉 This tells your training script:
“Look for training data inside data/multitask/”
It will expect:

train.bin

val.bin

meta.pkl

All generated from your tokenizer step.

🧠 Training Efficiency
gradient_accumulation_steps = 4
👉 We’re simulating a bigger batch size by:

Doing 4 forward+backward passes

Accumulating gradients

Then updating weights

Useful when GPU/CPU memory is limited.

batch_size = 2
👉 Only 2 examples are processed at once in each mini-batch.
Very small, but sometimes necessary if memory is low.

block_size = 256
👉 Each input the model sees is 256 tokens long.
It can only "see" this much at once.
If your sentence is longer — it’s chopped.

🏗️ Model Architecture (this defines the size of your GPT)
n_layer = 10
👉 10 Transformer blocks (like 10 floors of a building).
More layers = more powerful but slower.

n_head = 8
👉 Each Transformer block has 8 attention heads.
They learn different types of relationships between tokens (like who is related to who in the sentence).

n_embd = 384
👉 Each token is represented by a vector of size 384.
This is the feature size — the “depth” of the token understanding.

dropout = 0.1
👉 Randomly disables 10% of neurons during training.
Helps prevent overfitting (memorizing training set too closely).

⚙️ Other Training Settings
bias = False
👉 Whether to use bias terms in linear layers.
Setting it to False can make the model simpler and faster. Often used in small GPTs.

vocab_size = None
👉 This tells the model:
"Get the vocab size from meta.pkl" (the file you saved during tokenization).
Because you may change datasets or tokenizers.

learning_rate = 3e-4
👉 This controls how big each step is during learning.
3e-4 = 0.0003 = moderate learning speed.

max_iters = 3000
👉 Model will train for 3000 steps and then stop.
Think of this as number of chapters the model studies.

lr_decay_iters = 3000
👉 We start reducing the learning rate after these many steps.
In your case, same as max_iters, so it’ll gradually decay throughout training.

min_lr = 1e-5
👉 Learning rate won’t drop below this value.
Even at the end, the model keeps improving a little.

warmup_iters = 200
👉 For the first 200 steps, we slowly ramp up the learning rate.
Prevents the model from being shocked by a big step in the beginning.

⚙️ Compilation Flag
compile = False
👉 If using PyTorch 2.0 or later, you can compile the model for better speed.
You’ve turned it off for now, which is fine.

✅ Final Note
This config makes your GPT model:

Around 50 million parameters

Trained with modest batch sizes

Running for 3000 steps

On a dataset called multitask

Saved inside: out/babygpt_50m/

🧑‍🏫 Vipin, treat this config like your recipe card.

If you want a bigger model later — just increase n_layer, n_head, n_embd.

If you want more training — increase max_iters.

Let me know if you want a visual of the model size or graph of training steps.
